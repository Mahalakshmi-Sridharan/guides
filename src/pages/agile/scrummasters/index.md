## Scrummasters

A scrum master is the facilitator for an agile development team. Scrum is a methodology that allows a team to self-organize and make changes quickly, in accordance with agile principles. The scrum master manages the process for how information is exchanged.

During the daily meetings, which are sometimes called "scrums," the scrum master asks the team members these three questions: 

1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What will you do today?
3. Are there any impediments in your way?

The scrum master is responsible for:

1. Helping the team to reach consensus for what can be achieved during a specific period of time.
2. Helping the team to reach consensus during the daily scrum.
3. Helping the team to stay focused and follow the agreed-upon rules for daily scrums.
4. Removing obstacles that are impeding the team's progress.
5. Protecting the team from outside distractions.
