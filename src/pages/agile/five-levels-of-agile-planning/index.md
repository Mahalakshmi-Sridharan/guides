## Five Levels of Agile Planning

The 5 levels of Agile Planning are as follows.
1. Product Vision
2. Product Roadmap
3. Release Plan
4. Sprint Plan
5. Daily Commitment

### Product Vision

This vision will most likely be long term spanning an entire year or many years. The product vision helps stakeholders pass the elevator test - the ability to explain the project to someone within two minutes.

### Product Roadmap

The product roadmap is an overall view of the product's requirements and a valuable tool for planning and organizing the journey of product development. The roadmap is used to categorize requirements, to prioritize them, and to determine a timetable for their release.

### Release Plan

A release is what the name implies: a set of product increments that is released to the (internal) customer.

### Sprint Plan

Each sprint begins with a two-part sprint planning meeting. Part one of the sprint planning meeting is a review of the product backlog. This is the time for the product owner to describe what he/she wants to see built for the next sprint. During this part of the meeting, it is not uncommon for the team to ask clarifying questions and driving away ambiguity. By the end of sprint planning part one, the team will select a sprint goal: a one-sentence description of the overall outcome of the sprint. During part two of the sprint planning meeting, the team decides how the work will be built. In this meeting the team will begin decomposing the product backlog items into work tasks and estimating these in hours. The output of the second planning meeting will be the Sprint Backlog.

### Daily Commitment

The Daily Scrum or stand-up meeting is an important part of a Sprint. A good daily standup energizes the team and keeps the project on target. Each member updates the team on three points: what they worked on, what they are going to work on, and whether they are blocked. The Scrum Master facilitates and helps to address blockers to ensure the overall release is on track.
