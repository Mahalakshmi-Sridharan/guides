## Spikes

### Definition:

A story or task aimed at answering a question or gathering information, rather than at producing shippable product.

There are two other characteristics that spikes should have:

1. Have clear objectives and outcomes for the spike. Be clear on the knowledge you are trying to gain and the problem(s) you are trying to address.
2. Be timeboxed. Spikes should be timeboxed so you do just enough work that's just good enough to get the value required.
